## Project Overview

The **Spam Detection System** is a machine learning project designed to classify emails as **spam** or **not spam**. By leveraging two powerful algorithms—**Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier**—this project aims to accurately identify and filter out unwanted spam emails, enhancing email security and user experience.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing email data for effective model training.
- **Model Training**: Implementing Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using various metrics.
- **Prediction Saving**: Storing model predictions for future analysis.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of model performance through confusion matrices and feature importance plots.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Spambase Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase)
- **Description**: The dataset consists of 4,601 emails marked as spam or not spam, with 57 continuous features extracted from the emails.
- **Features**:
  - **Continuous variables**: Word frequency features, character frequency features, etc.
  - **Target variable**: Binary label indicating spam (`1`) or not spam (`0`).

## Models Used

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - **Purpose**: Serves as a baseline model for binary classification tasks.
   - **Advantages**: Simple, interpretable, and efficient for linearly separable data.

2. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - **Purpose**: An ensemble learning method for classification that operates by constructing multiple decision trees.
   - **Advantages**: Handles complex patterns, reduces overfitting, and provides feature importance metrics.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-detection-system.git
   cd spam-detection-system
